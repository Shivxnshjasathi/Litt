## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is a demonstration of modern Android development practices.

* **UI**: 100% [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) for a declarative, reactive, and modern UI.
* **Architecture**: Follows the recommended **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture.
* **Asynchronous Programming**: [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) are used extensively for background tasks like API calls and data processing.
* **Networking**:
    * [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for type-safe HTTP requests to the music API.
    * [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) as the underlying HTTP client, with an interceptor for logging.
* **JSON Parsing**: [Kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) for efficient and safe JSON parsing.
* **Image Loading**: [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) for fast, modern image loading with Jetpack Compose integration.
* **Music Playback**: [ExoPlayer (Media3)](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/media3) for robust and feature-rich audio playback.
* **Dynamic Theming**: [Palette API](https://developer.android.com/training/material-design/palette-api) to extract dominant colors from album art for a dynamic and immersive player UI.
* **Navigation**: [Jetpack Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation) for handling navigation between screens.
